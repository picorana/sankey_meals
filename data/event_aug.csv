(he really doesn't want to miss any recess and is pulled to get out there) I  went outside looking for Remy, calling to him, met up with his teacher who didn't know where he was.  We talked it over when i went back in building and R. was found.  He was in the bathroom and thought I knew.  I would like it reinforced that Remy stay very close to me after we dose him, by my side preferable.   Things happen and I can't communicate too well with him when he is several steps ahead, and/or running.  I've tried it though!"
